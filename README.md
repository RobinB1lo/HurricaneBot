- Hypothesis: When a hurricane is projected to hit Florida, stock prices of insurance companies based in florida, 
energy companies based in Florida, and cruise line companies based in Florida all go down on the short-term 
and go back up in the long-term depending on the severity of the Hurricane. I am looking to project these Hurricanes at least a week
before they hit and their severity (if they will be a direct hit or only hit a certain part) to determine when and how much to short these stocks
